# Bellman-Ford-Modified
Bellman Ford algorithm helps us find the shortest path from a vertex to all other vertices of a weighted graph but the algorithm doesn't work well with negative cycles as the weights of the vertices keeps on decreasing even when relaxation has occurred. So here the modified version is presented overcoming this drawback.
